# TheGist App
Taking notes is an important part of learning and remembering important information. When we research anything on the internet, most of the time we get information overload. After finding out the information we set out to get, most people prefer to make a note that makes sense to them. It is also a good idea to keep a reference of where you got your information from for a reference if needed at a later time. TheGist App helps you keep your notes organized, to the point, and easy to reference the original resource.
